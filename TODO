HTML/PreTeXt:

* Check everything.

Possibilities in the long term (possibly next possibly other edition):

* Vol I: Perhaps avoid the whole "well ordering of N" and "induction"
  equivalence bit.  We could just assume induction as axiom and have well ordering
  as a proposition.  Might require replacing the exercise 0.3.18 as we might want to
  just prove this in text.

* Vol II: Add the "crash course on Lebesgue" chapter

* Vol II: Add a chapter on submanifolds and differential forms.

For next edition:

* Vol I: Perhaps change "Min/max theorem" to "Extreme value theorem"?

* Change notation for uniform norm, perhaps $||f||_K$ if max is over
  $K$?  That would mesh well with the other books.  It very slightly
  conflicts with the alternative notation for euclidean norm $||x||_{\R^n}$
  in chapter 8, perhaps that's not an issue.

* Move to palatino to reduce line length and improve readability.
  Currently it is a bit too long for readability.  It seems like it wouldn't
  actually add too many pages to push it down by increasing left/right margins
  to about 80-85 cpl.  newpx as in diffyqs pushes it down to 85-90.

* Vol II: Explicitly add "mean value theorem" for functions of several
  variables along a straight line, it has a nice useful statement.  Proof can
  be left as exercise, should come around the definition of gradient.

* Vol II: Add full proof of Green's.  Perhaps to best fit within the current
  framework would be to cut the domain with a rectengular grid.  Under the
  extra assumption that only finitely many points on the boundary have
  horizontal or vertical tangents, a fine enough grid (cutting at all these
  critical points and corners and perhaps at more points to get at most one
  curve in each cell seems like it should make for an easy proof).

* Vol II:  Expand on 11.5, make it more about maximum principle.  Proof of the
  lemma 11.5 for analytic functions can still be left as an exercise.  Proof
  of the maximum principle is also an exercise, but state both, and maybe
  state one or two consequences of the principle other than fundamental
  theorem of calculus.

* Vol I: In 7.6, add an exercise for Picard with parameters, either
  continuous or C^1 perhaps that could use 6.2

* Vol I:
Suggestion from Arthur Busch for theorem 3.4.4:
"
Note that |x_n-y_n| < 1/n allows you to use the squeeze lemma on {x_n-y_n}, and conclude this sequence converges to 0.  Then apply B-W to {y_n} to get a subsequence {y_{n_k}} converging to some c in the domain.  Since the subsequence {x_{n_k} - y_{n_k}} must converge to 0, you can use the algebraic properties of limits to conclude that {x_{n_k}} also converges to c.  
You can then finish the proof with a quick case argument:  case 1:  Either {f(x_{n_k})} diverges or {f(y_{n_k})} diverges, which immediately makes f discontinuous at c.  case 2:  both these sequences converge, and then {f(x_{n_k}) - f(y_{n_k})} converges to Lx - Ly ≥ ε > 0 so at least one of these limits is different than f(c), making f discontinuous at c.

* Vol I:
Suggestion from Jacob Bernstein:
"
One thing that Strichartz did that I liked (and wasn't in your book as far as I could tell) was prove that if a function had positive derivative at x_0, then it is "locally monotone at x_0" in the sense that f(y)<f(x_0)<f(x) for x_0+\epsilon>x>x_0>y>x_0-\epsilon.  He compares this with the stronger result you get from the MVT.
"

* Mark better optional sections / subsections.  Perhaps "*" in subsection
  title, but then make sure it is really not required elsewhere.

Not so necessary but nice to haves

* Add appendix to Vol I on logic and formal proof writing similar to the Pitt
  one

MAYBEs:

* Maybe mark examples that are used in the sequel somehow. (This may be a
  daunting task, and more imprecise than one imagines, as what does "use"
  mean: What if it is used in a later example that isn't used otherwise?
  What if it is used in an optional section?  What if it appears in an
  offhand remark?)
* Maybe mark exercises whose proof is used in the text later.  Same issues
  as above.
* Maybe add appendix to Vol I on construction of the reals.  Perhaps start
  with construction of $\Q$ and then finish with Dedekind cuts.
