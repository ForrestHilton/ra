This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In definition of limit of a sequence, don't "cheat" and say "if a limit
	is unique."  I am starting to feel like this the previous way, while
	a little less wordy may be confusing to students.
<li>Do not shorten sequences to \(\{ x_n \},\) but always write out
	\(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty.\)  It seems to me this shorthand is
	causing more confusion than it is worth, especially with
	regards to the distinction between set and sequence, and also
	when working with subsequences.  FIXME: in progress.
<li>Do not shorten sequence limits to \(\lim\, x_n,\) but always write out
	\(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n.\)  It seems to me this shorthand is
	causing more confusion than it is worth, especially
	when subsequences are introduced.  FIXME: in progress.
<li>Rename section 3.3 to "Extreme and intermediate value theorems".
<li>Add a new Example 3.3.11 showing the existence of roots,
	so the old 3.3.11 becomes 3.3.12, and
	Corollary 3.3.12 becomes 3.3.13.  This is a nice application,
	and ties in some prior results, and it is good to see it especially
	of 4.4 is not covered.

Smaller changes:

<li>In the definition of \(S\) in Theorem 0.3.6, use \(n,\) to avoid overloading of \(m.\)
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
<li>Simplify parts (iii) and (iv) of Definition 1.1.2.
<li>In proof of part (v) of 1.1.8, should just use the definition rather than
  part (ii) of the proposition.
<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>In the proof of 1.2.6, use \(c\) instead of \(b\) for the second
  inequality to avoid overloading \(b.\)
<li>After definition of subsequences, give a little bit more detail of the
	example subsequence.
<li>After Proposition 2.1.10, make a remark about monotone sequences and
	boundedness above/below.
<li>Improve wording of Example 2.1.12.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 2.2.11, use \(x\) instead of \(L\) in the
  proof as \(L\) is used in the related Lemma 2.2.12 for something else.
<li><b>Exercise 2.2.9, add hypothesis that \(x_n\not=x\) for all \(n.\)</b>
	It is implied in that the limit makes sense,
	but it should be stated explicitly.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 2.3.4, when defining the subsequence, suppose
	\(n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1}\) is defined and define \(n_k\).  That way it
	is more consistent with the rest of the proof and should be easier
	to follow.  Also say \(m \geq n_{k-1}+1\) instead of \(m > n_{k-1}\)
	to make it clearer where the \(+1\) comes from.
<li>Change the index variable in Proof of Proposition 2.3.6 from \(j\) to
  \(n\) for consistency.
<li>Be more precise with the hint and the indexing in Exercise 2.3.7.  Also
  mention that it is just one of the possible proofs (I find it a cool proof).
<li>Remark 2.4.6 should refer to theorem not proposition.  Also clarify that
	Cauchy completeness means that the limit should be back in the set.
	The remark is purposefully vague (to omit the gory details),
	it's not really a definition, nor a construction of the reals,
	but we don't want to be misleading.
<li>In 2.5, when talking about the terms going to zero "fast enough"
	before the comparison test, this is about series with positive terms,
	so make that clear.
<li>In Definition 2.5.14 be consistent with wording for absolute
  and conditional convergence.  That is, change "is conditionally
  convergent" to "converges conditionally", and add both "converges
  conditionally" and "conditional convergence" to the index.
<li>Throughout, where appropriate, use \(i\) or another letter instead of \(j\)
	as that typesets a lot better with series and as powers.
<li>Clean up the proof of Proposition 2.6.2, the Alternating series test.
  Mainly improve the readability by using the variable names more
  consistently, rewrite the end of the proof, and fix an erratum.
<li>Rephrase Merten's theorem a tiny bit.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.11 part c, be more precise in the parenthetical remark
	about divergence.
<li>In Corollaries 3.1.9, 3.1.10, 3.1.11, the hypothesis is only needed
	for all \(x \in S \setminus \{ c \},\) as we do in all the other
	results of this section.  The way it is stated could
	be confusing, so change them to this hypothesis.  (It is equivalent
	because one can always replace \(S\) with \(S \setminus \{ c \} \)
	of course. <b>This affects
	Exercises 3.1.3 and 3.1.4, but it at worst makes them slightly less
	confusing and more straight forward.</b>
<li>Before Proposition 3.1.15, emphasize the meaning of it, that it means
	that the limit is "local."
<li>Below definition 3.2.1, we make a statement about the converse not
  holding, but with no reference.  An example is given in Example
  3.2.13 so give a parenthetical reference to it.
<li>Improve wording of Example 3.2.12.
<li>While fixing the labels in Figure 3.3, make them smaller so that they
  don't run into each other and move them below the axis.
<li>Before Lemma 3.3.1, emphasize that \([a,b]\) is a closed and bounded
	interval.  In a related change, this was emphasized in the statement
	of the Min-Max/Extreme value theorem, but that was making it too
	wordy, so make a remark right after the theorem and simplify the
	statement.
<li>When defining absolute minimum/absolute maximum, say that these are
	what \(f(c)\) is (as is shown in the figure).
<li>At the end of the proof of Proposition 3.3.10, when we claim the root
  by Bolzano, say it is in the open interval so that the claim lines up
  better with the theorem.
<li>Remove the "definition" of the phrase "uniformly continuous on \(X\)"
	as we only ever use it in a remark and it is not standard verbiage anyway.
<li>In Example 3.4.10, name the second function \(g\) to make things
  hopefully a bit clearer.
<li>Reword the paragraph in front of Corollary 4.4.3, now that we have the
	existence of roots as an explicit example in 3.3.
