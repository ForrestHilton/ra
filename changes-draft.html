This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In the definition of \(S\) in Theorem 0.3.6, use \(n,\) to avoid overloading of \(m.\)
<li>In proof of part (v) of 1.1.8, should just use the definition rather than
  part (ii) of the proposition.
<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>In Definition 2.1.16, include the \({}_{n=1}^\infty\) on the sequences
	to emphasize that \(\{n_i\}\) is a sequence in \(i.\)
<li>Improve wording of Example 2.1.12.
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
