This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Make Exercise 7.1.13 clearer in that the students need to prove that all
	the series in question actually converge, that is, that all those limits that
	one has to take actually exist.  That seems to be getting forgotten by almost
	all my students.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 7.2.16, make the first $\delta$ into an
	$\epsilon$ since those are two different numbers, that should clear
	up the proof a little bit.
