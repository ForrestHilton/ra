This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In Definition 0.3.11 (function), define codomain.  It does appear in at
  least one place in the book, and it may be good for the sake of being a
  reference book.
<li>In Definition 1.1.1 (ordered set), label "transitivity" and "trichotomy"
<li>Example 0.3.32 is a bit too informal and just leaves out 0 and the
  negatives, so add that.
<li>A few minor clarifications
