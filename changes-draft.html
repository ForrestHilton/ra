This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html


<p>

<ul>
<li>Remove the note before exercise 7.2.12.  It is obsolete and could be
confusing as we have already defined "subspace topology" above.
<li>Note after Definition 0.3.13 that $R(f)=f(A)$.
<li>Add very small example to composition of functions after Definition
  0.3.18.
<li>Add a couple of sentences about why existence of a bijection is
  an equivalence relation.
<li>Note why the only set with cardinality of 0 is the empty set.
<li>Many minor language and style improvements as well as some minor
  clarifications.
</ul>
