This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>When stating that well ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ and induction are
  equivalent, hedge our bets with "in a sense" and add a footnote mentioning
  that we are really assuming $n-1$ exists (which is obvious from the proof).
  In a related change, make exercise 0.3.18 just straight to the point and
  don't mention the equivalence.
<li>Make Proposition 1.4.1 more readable.
<li>Add $A \subset \overline{A}$ to Proposition 7.2.19 rather than just in text.
The proof flows much nicer then.
<li>Reword proof of proposition 7.2.14 to do the forward direction first.
