This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In the definition of \(S\) in Theorem 0.3.6, use \(n,\) to avoid overloading of \(m.\)
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
<li>In proof of part (v) of 1.1.8, should just use the definition rather than
  part (ii) of the proposition.
<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>In the proof of 1.2.6, use \(c\) instead of \(b\) for the second
  inequality to avoid overloading \(b.\)
<li>In Definition 2.1.16, include the \({}_{n=1}^\infty\) on the sequences
	to emphasize that \(\{n_i\}\) is a sequence in \(i.\)
<li>Improve wording of Example 2.1.12.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 2.2.11, use \(x\) instead of \(L\) in the
  proof as \(L\) is used in the related Lemma 2.2.12 for something else.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 2.3.4, when defining the subsequence, suppose
	\(n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1}\) is defined and define \(n_k\).  That way it
	is more consistent with the rest of the proof and should be easier
	to follow.  Also say \(m \geq n_{k-1}+1\) instead of \(m > n_{k-1}\)
	to make it clearer where the \(+1\) comes from.
<li>Change the index variable in Proof of Proposition 2.3.6 from \(j\) to
  \(n\) for consistency.
<li>Be more precise with the hint and the indexing in Exercise 2.3.7.  Also
  mention that it is just one of the possible proofs (I find it a cool proof).
<li>Remark 2.4.6 should refer to theorem not proposition.  Also clarify that
	Cauchy completeness means that the limit should be back in the set.
	The remark is purposefully vague (to omit the gory details),
	it's not really a definition, nor a construction of the reals,
	but we don't want to be misleading.
<li>In 2.5, when talking about the terms going to zero "fast enough"
	before the comparison test, this is about series with positive terms,
	so make that clear.
<li>In Definition 2.5.14 be consistent with wording for absolute
  and conditional convergence.  That is, change "is conditionally
  convergent" to "converges conditionally", and add both "converges
  conditionally" and "conditional convergence" to the index.
<li>In section 2.5, use \(i\) instead of \(j\) as that typesets a lot better
	with the series, also it allows us a couple of better pagebreaks
	on page 81-84, for example, the quip about "tail of series" is on
	the same page as the relevant proposition, and Proposition 2.5.12
	is no longer split over two pages.  Pagination is the same past page
	85.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.11 part c, be more precise in the parenthetical remark
	about divergence.
<li>Before Proposition 3.1.15, emphasize the meaning of it, that it means
	that the limit is "local."
<li>Below definition 3.2.1, we make a statement about the converse not
  holding, but with no reference.  An example is given in Example
  3.2.13 so give a parenthetical reference to it.
<li>While fixing the labels in Figure 3.3, make them smaller so that they
  don't run into each other and move them below the axis.
