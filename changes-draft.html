This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>After the definition of subsequence, in the first example \(
  \{\frac{1}{3i}\}_{i=1}^\infty ,\) write out the
  first few terms explicitly.
<li>In example, 7.3.7, use \([a,b]\) instead of \([0,1]\) for consistency
  with the previous example.
