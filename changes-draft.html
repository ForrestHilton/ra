This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li><b>Exercise 1.5.6 is way too challenging, and the hint is misleading.
  Replace with essentially the alternative from the footnote, and then
  replace the footnote with how one would prove existence of a bijection.</b>
<li>In the equation in the introductory paragraph of section 6.2, multiply
  both top and bottom of the fraction by $k$ as $\frac{n}{n+k}$ is much
  easier to read (and the point is just as well made) than
  $\frac{\frac{n}{k}}{\frac{n}{k} + 1}.$
<li>In the introduction to 6.2, do not mention just two types of exchanges,
  we cover four.
<li>In Theorem 6.2.2, say explicitly that $S \subset {\mathbb{R}}.$  (The
  proof works word for word in any metric space, but we haven't covered
  metric spaces yet.)
<li>Add a footnote to before Theorem 6.2.4 since I always mention this in
  class: Uniform continuity is in some sense overkill for this, uniformly
  bounded would be enough, but we don't prove this.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 6.2.10 use parentheses to make the beginning of
  the estimate clearer.
<li>In Exercise 6.2.1, remove the first sentence, it used to be this wordy because
  in old editions, this fact was not mentioned in text.
<li>Remove the Note after Exercise 6.2.2
<li>Make Exercise 7.1.13 clearer in that the students need to prove that all
	the series in question actually converge, that is, that all those limits that
	one has to take actually exist.  That seems to be getting forgotten by almost
	all my students.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 7.2.16, make the first $\delta$ into an
	$\epsilon$ since those are two different numbers, that should clear
	up the proof a little bit.
<li>Add a note after definition of the interior that alternately it is the
	union of open sets inside $A.$  Also note that the definition
	says gives that the interior is a subset of $A,$ but points of
	boundary may inside or outside $A.$
<li>Due to some minor edits, the pagination improved slightly by the proof
	of 7.2.22 being on the same page as the proposition and same
	with the proof of 7.2.27.  A couple of exercises thus jumped from
	page 245 to page 244.
<li><b>Exercise 7.3.1 was stated as if it is both directions of 7.3.13, while
    only one is left to prove.  So only state the direction left to prove.</b>
<li>In Exercise 7.5.6, emphasize that $K$ is a subset of any metric space,
  so that the student does not think $\mathbb{R}$ or something equally
  too simple.
<li>Simplify the proof of Proposition 7.5.12 a little.  We don't need to refer to
  sequences of functions and uniform convergence here, the direct estimate
  is easier.  Avoids unnecessary reference to chapter 6.
<li>In the beginning of the proof of the fixed point theorem in 7.6, decouple
  the first displayed inequality.  Do one step, then say "do $n$ more steps"
  and then write down the inequality with $k^n.$
