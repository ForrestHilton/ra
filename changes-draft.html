This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Add a very short finite example of cartesian product after Definition 0.3.10.
<li>Make Definition 0.3.11 (function) a bit easier to read by explicitly
  stating that it is the $y$ that is unique.
<li>In Definition 0.3.11 (function), define codomain.  It does appear in at
  least one place in the book, and it may be good for the sake of being a
  reference book.
<li>Example 0.3.32 is a bit too informal and just leaves out 0 and the
  negatives, so add that.
<li>Move the argument for why infimum and supremum are unique to right
	after Definition 1.1.2 and note why this means that the notation is
	well defined.
<li>In Definition 1.1.1 (ordered set), label "transitivity" and "trichotomy"
<li>Improve the wording of proof of 1.4.2, also in the same proof the sets $A$ and $B$
	were being defined but we only used $=$ and not $:=$.
<li>A few minor clarifications.
