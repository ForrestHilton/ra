This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>The hint for Exercise 1.5.6 is a bit confusing and it is actually not the
  easiest way to do it.  So simplify the hint and it will hopefully be
  clearer as to what to do.
<li>Make Exercise 7.1.13 clearer in that the students need to prove that all
	the series in question actually converge, that is, that all those limits that
	one has to take actually exist.  That seems to be getting forgotten by almost
	all my students.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 7.2.16, make the first $\delta$ into an
	$\epsilon$ since those are two different numbers, that should clear
	up the proof a little bit.
