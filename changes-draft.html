This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In definitions of limits (sequence, continuous limits, in metric spaces,
  etc), don't "cheat" and say "if a limit is unique."  While it feels a
  little wordy since the first thing we do is prove that the limit is 
  unique, I'm starting to feel that this may be contributing to confusion
  about proof writing to students.
<li>Do not shorten sequences to \(\{ x_n \},\) but always write out
	\(\{x_n\}_{n=1}^\infty.\)  It seems to me this shorthand is
	causing more confusion than it is worth, especially with
	regards to the distinction between set and sequence, and also
	when working with subsequences.  FIXME: in progress.
<li>Do not shorten sequence limits to \(\lim\, x_n,\) but always write out
	\(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n.\)  It seems to me this shorthand is
	causing more confusion than it is worth, especially
	when subsequences are introduced.  FIXME: in progress.
<li>Uniform norm notation is changed to \(\|\cdot\|_K,\)
  where \(K\) is the set where the supremum is taken.  I've had a number of
  complaints about the \(u\) notation not being very standard.  And this goes
  better with my other books where I use the more standard notation.
<li>Rename section 3.3 to "Extreme and intermediate value theorems".
<li>Add a new Example 3.3.11 showing the existence of roots,
	so the old 3.3.11 becomes 3.3.12, and
	Corollary 3.3.12 becomes 3.3.13.  This is a nice application,
	and ties in some prior results, and it is good to see it especially
	of 4.4 is not covered.
<li>Add Figure 1.3 on the set \(\{ \frac{1}{n} : n \in {\mathbb{N}} \}\)
  and its infimum (Corollary 1.2.5) (renumbers all the following figures in chapter 1).
<li>Simplify proof of Proposition 2.1.7 by just defining the \(B\) once
  rather than defining two different bounds.
<li>Add Figure 3.1 for Example 3.1.6 where limit is different from
  value (renumbers all figures in chapter 3).
<li>Add Figure 3.8 for the Corollary 3.3.13 (was 3.3.12) where
  image of a continuous function is an interval.
<li>Add Figure 3.10 to note why visually the square root is not Lipschitz.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 5.2.2 mention boundedness to be completely 
  rigorous.
<li>In Exercise 5.3.7, add \(a+\epsilon \lt b-\epsilon\) to emphasize where
  things are well defined.
<li>Add Figure 7.2, to clarify especially the end of Example 7.1.3.  This
  renumbers the rest of figures in chapter 7.
<li>To be more consistent, and avoid overuse of the letter x for everything,
  use \(p\) instead of \(x\) in Propositions 7.3.11, 7.3.12, 7.3.13, 7.4.2,
  Exercises 7.3.1, 7.3.5, 7.3.7, and Definition 7.4.2
<li>Move the remark about subspaces not being complete after Proposition
  7.4.5 as it makes more sense that way.
<li>In Definition 7.4.7, Example 7.4.8, and the proof of Proposition 7.4.9,
  use \(m\) instead of \(k\) to avoid overusing the letter \(k,\) to make
  it easier to talk about the proof.
<li>Add a paragraph after Proposition 7.4.9 emphasizing the difference
  between compactness and closedness in the sense that "compact" doesn't
  care about the ambient topology while "closed" most definitely does.
<li>Rewrite the \(n=1\) part of the proof of 7.4.13 (Heine-Borel) to be a
  little bit more like \(n=2\) part (use the proposition to reduce to
  closed and bounded interval) and just refer to Example 2.3.8 instead of
  repeating the argument.

Smaller changes:

<li>In the definition of \(S\) in Theorem 0.3.6, use \(n,\) to avoid overloading of \(m.\)
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
<li>Simplify parts (iii) and (iv) of Definition 1.1.2.
<li>In proof of part (v) of 1.1.8, should just use the definition rather than
  part (ii) of the proposition.
<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>In the proof of 1.2.6, use \(c\) instead of \(b\) for the second
  inequality to avoid overloading \(b.\)
<li>After definition of subsequences, give a little bit more detail of the
	example subsequence.
<li>After Proposition 2.1.10, make a remark about monotone sequences and
	boundedness above/below.
<li>Improve wording of Example 2.1.12.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 2.2.11, use \(x\) instead of \(L\) in the
  proof as \(L\) is used in the related Lemma 2.2.12 for something else.
<li><b>Exercise 2.2.9, add hypothesis that \(x_n\not=x\) for all \(n.\)</b>
	It is implied in that the limit makes sense,
	but it should be stated explicitly.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 2.3.4, when defining the subsequence, suppose
	\(n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1}\) is defined and define \(n_k\).  That way it
	is more consistent with the rest of the proof and should be easier
	to follow.  Also say \(m \geq n_{k-1}+1\) instead of \(m \gt n_{k-1}\)
	to make it clearer where the \(+1\) comes from.
<li>Change the index variable in Proof of Proposition 2.3.6 from \(j\) to
  \(n\) for consistency.
<li>Be more precise with the hint and the indexing in Exercise 2.3.7.  Also
  mention that it is just one of the possible proofs (I find it a cool proof).
<li>Remark 2.4.6 should refer to theorem not proposition.  Also clarify that
	Cauchy completeness means that the limit should be back in the set.
	The remark is purposefully vague (to omit the gory details),
	it's not really a definition, nor a construction of the reals,
	but we don't want to be misleading.
<li>In 2.5, when talking about the terms going to zero "fast enough"
	before the comparison test, this is about series with positive terms,
	so make that clear.
<li>In Definition 2.5.14 be consistent with wording for absolute
  and conditional convergence.  That is, change "is conditionally
  convergent" to "converges conditionally", and add both "converges
  conditionally" and "conditional convergence" to the index.
<li>Throughout, where appropriate, use \(i\) or another letter instead of \(j\)
	as that typesets a lot better with series and as powers.
	In some places this also changes the other indices.
<li>Clean up the proof of Proposition 2.6.2, the Alternating series test.
  Mainly improve the readability by using the variable names more
  consistently, rewrite the end of the proof, and fix an erratum.
<li>Rephrase Merten's theorem a tiny bit.
<li>In Exercise 2.6.11 part c, be more precise in the parenthetical remark
	about divergence.
<li>In Corollaries 3.1.9, 3.1.10, 3.1.11, the hypothesis is only needed
	for all \(x \in S \setminus \{ c \},\) as we do in all the other
	results of this section.  The way it is stated could
	be confusing, so change them to this hypothesis.  (It is equivalent
	because one can always replace \(S\) with \(S \setminus \{ c \} \)
	of course. <b>This affects
	Exercises 3.1.3 and 3.1.4, but it at worst makes them slightly less
	confusing and more straight forward.</b>
<li>Before Proposition 3.1.15, emphasize the meaning of it, that it means
	that the limit is "local."
<li>Below definition 3.2.1, we make a statement about the converse not
  holding, but with no reference.  An example is given in Example
  3.2.13 so give a parenthetical reference to it.
<li>Improve wording of Example 3.2.12.
<li>While fixing the labels in Figure 3.4 (was 3.3), make them smaller so that they
  don't run into each other and move them below the axis.
<li>Before Lemma 3.3.1, emphasize that \([a,b]\) is a closed and bounded
	interval.  In a related change, this was emphasized in the statement
	of the Min-Max/Extreme value theorem, but that was making it too
	wordy, so make a remark right after the theorem and simplify the
	statement.
<li>When defining absolute minimum/absolute maximum, say that these are
	what \(f(c)\) is (as is shown in the figure).
<li>At the end of the proof of Proposition 3.3.10, when we claim the root
  by Bolzano, say it is in the open interval so that the claim lines up
  better with the theorem.
<li>Remove the "definition" of the phrase "uniformly continuous on \(X\)"
  as we only ever use it in a remark and it is not standard verbiage anyway.
<li>In Example 3.4.10, name the second function \(g\) to make things
  hopefully a bit clearer.
<li>Make caption to Figure 3.12 a bit more precise.
<li>Make the Lemma 4.2.2 be stated for an open interval \((a,b)\) since we
  don't need the endpoints and it could really just be confusing.
<li>In Lemma 4.2.2, move the initial sentence of the proof to the end and
  reword it.
<li>After Theorem 4.2.4, say explicitly that the slope of the secant line
  is the mean value of the derivative, hence the name of the theorem.
<li>In subsection 4.2.4 (applications of the mean value theorem) add a short
  description what how the applications work: by getting rid of a limit.
<li>At the end of Example 4.2.12, be a little less wordy.
<li>Reword the paragraph in front of Corollary 4.4.3, now that we have the
  existence of roots as an explicit example in 3.3.
<li>In Proof of Proposition 5.1.7, use (in addition to changing \(j\) to
  \(i\)) \(q\) instead of \(p\) since I just realized that this is a
  terrible name since the partition is \(P.\)  Also changes Figure 5.2.
<li>Explicitly mention in the beginning of the proof of Lemma 5.2.7
  that \(f\) is bounded.
<li>Reorganize the setup in proof of Proposition 7.2.11 a bit.
<li>Add a small note after Heine--Borel (7.4.14) to emphasize it does not
  hold in subspaces of \({\mathbb{R}}^n.\)
<li>In Exercise 7.5.2, reference the figure with the graph.
<li>Rewrite Proposition 7.4.9 to emphasize in which direction the
  implication goes.
<li>Reword Exercise 2.6.4 part a) to be a little easier to understand
  what is being asked
<li>Reword Example 3.5.3 a little.
