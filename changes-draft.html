This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
