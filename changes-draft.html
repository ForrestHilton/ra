This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>When stating that well ordering of $\mathbb{N}$ and induction are
  equivalent, hedge our bets with "in a sense" and add a footnote mentioning
  that we are really assuming $n-1$ exists (which is obvious from the proof).
  In a related change, make exercise 0.3.18 just straight to the point and
  don't mention the equivalence.
<li>Reword the beginning of the proof of Example 1.2.3.
<li>Make Proposition 1.4.1 more readable.
<li>In the proofs of Propositions 2.3.2, 2.3.6, Example 3.1.8, when referring to a sequence, always
  use braces.
<li>Add explicit link/reference to chapter 7 to remark 2.4.6.
<li>Add another restriction on which $g$ is continuous to Example 3.2.13.
<li>Reword Lemma 3.3.1, Theorem 3.3.2 (min-max) as a simpler single sentence.
<li>Make the Min-max theorem alternatively titled Extreme value theorem which
  is more common.  Emphasize the "closed and bounded" in the theorem
  statement.
<li>Reword the proof of Proposition 4.1.10 a little bit to make it clearer.
  Also include a tiny bit more motivation.
<li>Talk about "fog" to the intro for critical points.
<li>Add Remark 5.1.15 to say something about integral being a sum and being
  global as opposed to derivatives being local.
<li>In 5.2 add a few more motivating sentences.  And merge the paragraph from
  below Proposition 5.2.5 to the one above it to make things flow a little better.
<li>Mark 5.5.13 as Integral test, and add that to the index.
<li>Reword proof of Proposition 7.2.14 to do the forward direction first.
<li>Add $A \subset \overline{A}$ to Proposition 7.2.19 rather than just in text.
  The proof flows much nicer then.
<li>Several small clarifications.
<li>A few more explicit references/links.
