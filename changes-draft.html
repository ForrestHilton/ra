This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

<li>In the definition of \(S\) in Theorem 0.3.6, use \(n,\) to avoid overloading of \(m.\)
<li>Say that \(A\) is a set in Cantor to be a bit more precise.
<li>In proof of part (v) of 1.1.8, should just use the definition rather than
  part (ii) of the proposition.
<li>Improve wording around Proposition 1.2.2, remove some unnecessary words
	and explicitly state the version with \(|x|,\) which is a common
	statement.
<li>In the proof of 1.2.6, use \(c\) instead of \(b\) for the second
  inequality to avoid overloading \(b.\)
<li>In Definition 2.1.16, include the \({}_{n=1}^\infty\) on the sequences
	to emphasize that \(\{n_i\}\) is a sequence in \(i.\)
<li>Improve wording of Example 2.1.12.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 2.2.11, use \(x\) instead of \(L\) in the
  proof as \(L\) is used in the related Lemma 2.2.12 for something else.
<li>Change the index variable in Proof of Proposition 2.3.6 from \(j\) to
  \(n\) for consistency.
