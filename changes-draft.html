This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes.html

The theme of this revision is trying to fix all the minor issues and errata I
could find, and improve clarity, but not make any large changes, nor add any
content.  Perhaps the biggest change is 2 new exercises that are there really
to fix an erratum.  There are a few new explanatory sentences here and there,
but nothing new beyond that.

<li>Add a very short finite example of cartesian product after
  Definition 0.3.10.
<li>Make Definition 0.3.11 (function) a bit easier to read by explicitly
  stating that it is the $y$ that is unique.
<li>In Definition 0.3.11 (function), define codomain.  It does appear in at
  least one place in the book, and it may be good for the sake of being a
  reference book.
<li>Example 0.3.32 is a bit too informal and just leaves out 0 and the
  negatives, so add that.
<li>Move the argument for why infimum and supremum are unique to right
  after Definition 1.1.2 and note why this means that the notation is
  well-defined.
<li>In Definition 1.1.1 (ordered set), label "transitivity" and "trichotomy"
<li>Remove the first sentence of the proof of Proposition 1.1.9 and just
  give the example before the proof.  It is not really part of the "proof" of
  the statement itself.
<li>In the proof of Example 1.2.3, the second displayed estimate, the $h$ is
  given as an equality, so the last $\leq$ is actually $=$.
  Also show explicitly that $s-h &gt; 0$ to fix erratum.
<li>Improve the wording of proof of 1.4.2, also in the same proof the sets
  $A$ and $B$ were being defined but we only used $=$ and not $:=$.  Also,
  change $b_k$ to just be any number in $(a_k,b_{k-1})$, that is simpler and
  sufficient.
<li>In Definition 2.1.9, move the "Some authors use the word monotonic." to a
  footnote to simplify the definition.
<li>After definition 2.1.9 mention $\{ n \}$ as an example of a monotone
  increasing sequence.
<li>Simplify the proof of Proposition 2.1.10.  Don't say anything about the
  $B$, we never use the bound, just say the set of values is bounded, that is
  good enough to compute the supremum.
<li>After Definition 2.1.16, explicitly mention what we mean by a subsequence
  by writing $x_{n_1},x_{n_2},x_{n_3},\ldots$.
<li>Add Exercise 2.1.23
<li>In Proposition 2.2.11, recast the proof of unboundedness to not be a
  contradiction proof.  It's the same idea, but it avoids having to explain
  why it is a contradiction, and avoids a contradiction proof.
<li>In Example 2.2.14, use $M$ instead of $N$ for consistency.
<li>Add Exercise 2.3.20
<li>Before Proposition 2.5.6, make "tail of a series" a defined term and add
  it to index.
<li>Rephrase the last argument in the proof of Proposition 2.5.17 to be a
  little bit more straightforward.
<li>Add useful remark to Exercise 2.5.6.
<li>Add remark to Exercise 2.5.16 about starting the series, and that only
  tails satisfy the hypotheses, so that students do not forget to check these
  technicalities.
<li>Add footnote on $L=\infty$ to proof of Proposition 2.6.1
<li>Add a better introductory sentence to cluster points in 3.1.1.
<li>In Lemma 3.1.7 and Proposition 3.1.17, add $L \in {\mathbb{R}}$ to the
  hypotheses, that makes it clearer that it is a given number.
<li>Since every semester I get a question about exercise 3.1.1, add a
  parenthetical remark: Yes one must prove the limit is what one claims
  it is.
<li>When proving the Thomae function (3.2.12) is continuous at irrational
  numbers, note that since the limit of $\{ x_n \}$ is $c$, then every
  rational number is in the sequence at most finitely many times.
<li>At the end of example 3.2.13, mention that $g$ is in fact continuous on $B$.
<li>After proof of Lemma 3.3.1, add a short paragraph highlighting the use of
  Bolzano-Weierstrass, to emphasize the technique.  It changes the pagination
  of 3.3 a tiny bit (inadvertently getting less jarring page breaks)
<li>Reword slightly the end of the proof of Example 3.4.3 to improve clarity.
<li>Add two lines of text after proof of Theorem 3.4.4 to make a similar
  point as for 3.3.1, again changing pagination of the rest of 3.4 very
  slightly.
<li>Be a little bit more precise in the proof of Lemma 4.2.2 to say that
  all the $x$ and the $y$ are still within $\delta$ of $c$.
<li>Throughout get rid of the use of the word "any" where it could be ambiguous.
<li>Improve the typesetting of some statements.
<li>Some minor clarifications and tightening of the language a bit throughout
  the book.
