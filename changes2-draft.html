This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li><b>Change exercise 8.5.8</b> to fix erratum, namely change part e to have the
  student check that the map is not open.
<li>The word "domain" meaning "open connected set" was sometimes used without
  being defined. We have only defined it in a special case in 10.6 and
  another in 9.3, so reword all other places where it was used.
<li>Namely, change Exercise  10.6.3 to say that \(U\) is just an open set,
  the student might read "domain" as meaning in the specific
  sense it was used in the section which isn't needed.
<li>Give Proposition 11.4.1 the standard name "Law of exponents".
<li>In the paragraph listing consequences of 11.4.1, give the law for powers
  as we keep using this and it's good to explicitly state this.
<li>State item (vi) of Proposition 11.4.2 for all complex numbers and refer
  to the exercise in the proof.  Also reword and clarify some parts of the proof.
<li><b>Replace Exercise 11.4.4</b> to fix an erratum: The exercise
  was already solved in the text.  Therefore, ask for another consequence
  with about as simple a proof: That the exponential is onto the complex
  plane minus the origin.
