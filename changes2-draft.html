This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>The word "symmetric" as used for a dot product is in the index.
<li>Define properly that the span of the empty set is \(\{0\}.\)
<li>In Proposition 8.1.11, add a sentence about \(0\) being in \(Y\)
  before the proposition.
<li>After Definition 8.1.12 note explicitly that no vector in a linearly
  independent set can be zero, that \(\{0\}\) is the only
  vector space of dimension 0, and note that the empty set
  is trivially linearly independent and spans \(\{0\}\).
<li>Improve the proof of part (ii) of Proposition 8.1.14.  And in the
  beginning mention that \(d=0\) is trivial for all statements.
<li>When stating that \(L(X,Y)\) is a vector space, explicitly mention that 
  0 is the linear map taking everything to 0.
<li>In Proof of 8.1.18, flip the \(=0\) to be at the front as that is
  slightly clearer.
<li>Add a short paragraph with the example of \(X={\mathbb{R}}^1\)
  for the operator norm right after the definition (8.2.3)
<li>Add a footnote about the acronym GL for general linear group to
  Proposition 8.2.6.
<li>In the proof of 8.2.6 part (ii), note that (i) immediately implies that
  \(GL(X)\) is open, meaning we only need to prove that the
  inverse is continuous.  In the same proof, note the use of
  the rank-nullity theorem.
<li>When giving what the column of the matrix represents be more specific to
  say that the \(j\)th column represents the \(A x_j\) vector.
<li>Reorder the discussion about matrix multiplication obn page 24, and
  explicitly note that unless otherwise specified we identify the set of
  m-by-n matrices and \(L({\mathbb{R}}^n,{\mathbb{R}}^m).\)
<li>To fix an erratum, Proposition 8.2.7 was changed.  In the discussion
  before hand, show that the euclidean norm of the entries is bounded by
  square root of \(n\) times the operator norm.  Then the proposition
  is about the topology being the same.  We also add the conclusion about
  continuous functions both with the domain and codomain being
  the operators (or matrices).
<li><b>Exercise 8.2.4, part b).  Give a hint on how one could describe
  \(B(0,1)\) as for example a convex hull and tell the student to think
  about it in \(\mathbb{R}}^2\) and \({\mathbb{R}}^3.\).</b>  It is still
  somewhat open to interpretation, but in some sense, this part is meant to
  make the student think, so that's OK.
<li><b>Exercise 8.2.15</b> change the hint, I cannot follow the previous
  hint, I wonder if it is a typo.
<li><b>Exercise 8.2.16</b> Add a hint to part a (it is still possibly quite
  challenging).  Also emphasize that we
  are working on \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) with the euclidean norm.
<li>Before Theorem 8.3.7, when giving the intuition, use
  \({\mathbb{R}}^n,\) \({\mathbb{R}}^m,\) and \({\mathbb{R}}^k\) instead
  of \(X,\) \(Y,\) and \(Z.\)
<li>Add "tangent vector" to the index and mark it in 8.3.3 when defining
  derivative of a curve.  Also mention it in the caption to Figure 8.5,
  along with mentioning that we are assuming \(\gamma\) is defined up to
  the endpoints for clarity.
<li>After definition of directional derivative, do mention that we could
  have used any path \(\gamma\) as long as it had the right derivative
  at zero.
<li>In proof of Theorem 8.5.1, mention what \(g\) is in the proof.  Then 
  during the proof that \(W\) is open, use \(x_1\) for a random point in
  \(C(x_0,r)\) to avoid confusion with the fixed point \(x\) later in the
  paragraph.
<li>In Example 8.5.4, note that the \(f\) is onto
  \({\mathbb{R}}^2 \setminus \{ (0,0) \} .\)
<li>In Theorem 8.5.8, write \(A=[A_x~A_y]\) in the statement as \(A\) is used
  towards the end of the proof just as it is used as in the previous
  proposition.
<li>In proof of Theorem 9.1.1, emphasize
  that the \(y_1\) may have depended on \(x,\) even though the
  estimate does not.
<li>Reorder the first two pages of 10.1 a little bit by moving the remarks
  out of the definition.  It flows a bit better now.
<li>In Definition 10.3.1, explicitly mention that we are allowing \(\infty .\)
<li>In proof of Proposition 10.3.2, we explicitly mention that the
  rectangles in question are all of positive volume, and there is no reason
  to consider closed rectangles, so don't mention that.
<li>In the last estimate of the proof of 11.8.12, there is an unnecessary
  step that was there to use a real version of Cauchy-Schwarz
  inequality (but the complex one is referred to here).  So the middle
  line in the estimate can just be removed.
