This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

rename subsection 10.3.3 to "Images of null sets under differentiable
functions"

In proof of Lemma 10.3.9, say how to prove it for open balls.

In Exercise 8.4.7, assume $q$ is not identically zero.  The result is
vacuously true even if $q$ is identically zero, but there is no reason to make students
think about this rather stupid technicality.

The proof in Example 8.1.25 is hopefully clearer.
