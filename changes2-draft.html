This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>In Exercise 8.4.7, assume $q$ is not identically zero.  The result is
  vacuously true even if $q$ is identically zero, but there is no reason to
  make students think about this rather stupid technicality.
<li>The proof in Example 8.1.25 is hopefully clearer.
<li>In definition 8.3.8, remove the definition of the notation $D_j f$.  We
  never used it later.
<li>In Definition 9.2.1, change the definition of "simple" for non-closed
  paths.  Typically a path that bites itself back in the middle is not called
  simple, so rule out that case.
<li>Rename subsection 10.3.3 to "Images of null sets under differentiable
  functions".
<li>In proof of Lemma 10.3.9, say how to prove it for open balls.
<li>Improve definition 10.6.1 to be (much) simpler (though equivalent): Only
  take a finite disjoint union of simple closed sets as we are assuming $U$
  is bounded anyway.
<li>Reorder the proof of Theorem 10.7.2 a little bit to make it more logical.
