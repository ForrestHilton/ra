This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>Many small improvements in wording in 8.1.
<li>Add the addition/scaling meaning to the arrow figure (8.1), and
  mention it in text.
<li>In the definition of dimension, make it "\(d\) is the largest
  integer such that \(X\) contains a set of \(d\) linearly independent
  vectors" to make the definition be a priory well-defined instead of
  relying on the following paragraph.  Consequently move the
  statement of the previous definition (there is a set of \(d\)
  linearly independent vectors but not a set of \(d+1\) independent
  vectors) to the paragraph afterwards.
<li>Relabel some of the indices in 8.1 and improve the typesetting at the
  same time.  Use \(k\) more consistently when running
  over the indices, \(n\) for size of a basis, and \(m\) for the size of
  a set of vectors.
<li>Simplify the discussion about the sum of two linear combinations being a
  linear combination.  It is a trivial point and the discussion was
  unnecessarily complicated.
<li>Move the remark about it being better to use the abstract definition
  to a more logical place after the \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) example.
<li>Add comment about span being the smallest subspace containing \(Y\)
  after Proposition 8.1.11 to make that sentence about if \(Y\) is already a
  subspace a bit less mysterious.
<li>Add a note to Definition 8.1.12 that we usually consider the basis
  to be ordered, not just a set.
<li>Right after Proposition 8.1.14, add a short note about linearly
  independent set of \(d\) vectors (where \(d\) is the dimension) automatically
  spans, that's a particular case for \(m=d\) in the last item.
<li>Rewrite the claim in part (ii) in the proof of 8.1.14, and also the
  proof of part (vi).
<li>Add the statements before Proposition 8.1.16 into the proposition.  And
  add an explicit easy exercise (8.1.20) to prove the statements.
<li>Add \([x,y]\) for a line segment to the notations index.
<li>Move Proposition 8.1.24 after the construction of convex hull as that
  makes more sense.  This changes the numbers, the proposition is now 8.1.25
  and Example 8.1.25 is now Example 8.1.24.  Add a short introduction
  to the proposition and make the proposition more
  consistent with the notation of the section.
<li>Always use \((1-t)x+t y\) in this order for convex combination.
<li>In subsection 8.1.4 use \(X\) and \(Y\) for vector spaces and \(U\)
  and \(V\) for subsets to be more consistent with the rest of the section.
<li>Add "Compare ..." for Exercises 8.1.4 and 8.1.16 to reference each other.
<li>Reword Exercise 8.1.18 to be slightly clearer.
<li>In 8.2 as in 8.1, avoid \(j\) as an index in some places.
<li>Add a short sentence that the inequality
	\(\|Ax\| \leq C \|x\|\) proves \(\|A\| \leq C.\)
<li>In introducing matrix multiplication use \(z_1,\ldots,z_n\) instead of
	\(c_1,\ldots,c_n\) as \(c_{i,j}\) is used in the same paragraph for
	something else.  When doing the bound on the norm a bit later
	\(c=(c_1,\ldots,c_n)\) as our element in \({\mathbb{R}}^n.\)
<li>Add figure to illustrate what we mean by determinant stretching space for
  a specific matrix.  This renumbers figures in chapter 8.
<li>Be more precise in the statement of Proposition 8.2.10.
<li>Make Exercises 8.2.12 and 8.2.13 clearer by using different notations for
  the different norms.
<li>Add a note that Jacobian could confusingly also refer to the matrix,
  for this reason, switch to always saying "Jacobian determinant" in the book.
<li>In Proposition 8.4.2, use \(p\) and \(q\) instead of \(x\) and \(y\)
	to avoid confusion given the relevant example that comes right after
	uses \(x\) and \(y\) for the coordinates in the plane.
<li>In the proof of 8.4.4, use \(c_0\) for the specific constant instead of
  \(c\) since we just said "for all \(c\)" in the sentence before.
<li>In the proof of 8.4.6, to emphasize that \(x\) is fixed use \(p\)
	instead.  While at it, change \(k\) to \(h'\) since \(k\) is often
	used as an integer and to be consistent with the \(A'\) naming.
	In fact, use \(j\) and \(k\) in the same
	capacity as in 8.3 for consistency \(k\) for the component of \(f\)
	and \(j\) for the component of \(x.\)
<li>In 8.5, move the paragraph about contraction mapping principle after
  stating the theorem, it was kind of putting the cart before the horse the
  way it was stated.
<li>More consistent use of indices in section 8.6.  Use \(\ell) and \(m\)
  for components of \(x,\) \(k\) for order and don't use \(j\) at all
  (the others are easier to read, typeset more nicely)
<li>In the proof of Proposition 8.6.2, don't use the notation
  \({\mathbb{R}}_{+}^2\) as it wasn't quite right.  Just say the domain of
  \(g\) is \((0,\epsilon) \times (0,\epsilon) .\)
<li>Add Figure 9.2 for Exercise 9.1.6.
<li>Make the proof of Proposition 10.1.13 more precise and less handwavy.
<li>In the proof of Fubini change j to i and k to j.  That way we don't have
	k going from 1 to K which is confusing.
<li>Add Figure 10.3 to proof of Proposition 10.1.13, renumbers the other
	figures in chapter 10.
<li>In Exercises 10.1.3 and 10.1.4, emphasize that the rectangles are closed.
<li>Add Figure 10.5 to example 10.2.1.
<li>Proposition 11.2.7 needs to assume that \(Y\) is Cauchy-complete
  (erratum), then perhaps it is not completely clear why 11.2.8 is a
  corollary since we do not assume completeness, so add a note on why.
<li>Move the sentence defining the radius of convergence and the figure up
	in front of the proof, it might make more sense that way.
<li>Be more consistent with indices in subsection 11.3.4, replace \(j\) with \(m\) in
  the first part to be consistent with the second part.  Also add
  comma between the indices as in some of the other places.
<li>Similarly for Exercise 11.3.1.
<li>Rename section 11.4 "Complex exponential and trigonometric functions"
  (remove the definite articles for simplicity)
<li>Make indices in the Fourier series section 11.8 more consistent
