This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>Be more precise in the statement of Proposition 8.2.10.
<li>More consistent use of indices in section 8.6.  Use \(\ell) and \(m\)
  for components of \(x,\) \(k\) for order and don't use \(j\) at all
  (the others are easier to read, typeset more nicely)
<li>Add figure 9.2 for Exercise 9.1.6.
<li>Proposition 11.2.7 needs to assume that \(Y\) is Cauchy-complete
  (erratum), then perhaps it is not completely clear why 11.2.8 is a
  corollary since we do not assume completeness, so add a note on why.
<li>Be more consistent with indices in subsection 11.3.4, replace \(j\) with \(m\) in
  the first part to be consistent with the second part.  Also add
  comma between the indices as in some of the other places.
<li>Similarly for Exercise 11.3.1.
<li>Rename section 11.4 "Complex exponential and trigonometric functions"
  (remove the definite articles for simplicity)
<li>Make indices in the Fourier series section 11.8 more consistent
