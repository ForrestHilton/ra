This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>The word "symmetric" as used for a dot product is in the index.
<li>Define properly that the span of the empty set is \(\{0\}.\)
<li>In Proposition 8.1.11, add a sentence about \(0\) being in \(Y\) before the proposition.
<li>After Definition 8.1.12 note explicitly that no vector in a linearly
	independent set can be zero, that \(\{0\}\) is the only
	vector space of dimension 0, and note that the empty set
	is trivially linearly independent and spans \(\{0\}\).
<li>Improve the proof of part (ii) of Proposition 8.1.14.  And in the
	beginning mention that \(d=0\) is trivial for all statements.
<li>When stating that \(L(X,Y)\) is a vector space, explicitly mention that 
	0 is the linear map taking everything to 0.
<li>In Proof of 8.1.18, flip the \(=0\) to be at the front as that is
	slightly clearer.
<li>Add a short paragraph with the example of \(X={\mathbb{R}}^1\)
	for the operator norm right after the definition (8.2.3)
<li>Add a footnote about the acronym GL for general linear group to
	Proposition 8.2.6.
<li>In the proof of 8.2.6 part (ii), note that (i) immediately implies that
	\(GL(X)\) is open, meaning we only need to prove that the
	inverse is continuous.
<li>In Theorem 8.5.8, write \(A=[A_x~A_y]\) in the statement as \(A\) is used
  towards the end of the proof just as it is used as in the previous proposition.
<li>In the last estimate of the proof of 11.8.12, there is an unnecessary
	step that was there to use a real version of Cauchy-Schwarz
	inequality (but the complex one is referred to here).  So the middle
	line in the estimate can just be removed.
