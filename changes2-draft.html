This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>In Example 9.3.7, use \((0,0)\) instead of \(0\) for the origin
  in \({\mathbb{R}}^2\) for clarity.
<li>The note in Exercise 10.3.11 is made more precise: The cantor set
  is not a <emph>countable</emph> union of intervals <emph>or points</emph>.
<li>Right after Definition 10.5.4, mention that the integral is
  well-defined for the same reason as the volume.
<li>A few more details added in Example 10.6.5.
