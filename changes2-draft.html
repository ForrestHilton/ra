This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>The word "symmetric" as used for a dot product is in the index.

<li>In Theorem 8.5.8, write $A=[A_x~A_y]$ in the statement as $A$ is used
  towards the end of the proof just as it is used as in the previous proposition.
<li>In the last estimate of the proof of 11.8.12, there is an unnecessary
	step that was there to use a real version of Cauchy-Schwarz
	inequality (but the complex one is referred to here).  So the middle
	line in the estimate can just be removed.
