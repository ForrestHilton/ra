This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li><b>Change exercise 8.5.8</b> to fix erratum, namely change part e to have the
  student check that the map is not open.
<li>The word "domain" meaning "open connected set" was sometimes used without
  being defined. We have only defined it in a special case in 10.6 and
  another in 9.3, so reword all other places where it was used.
