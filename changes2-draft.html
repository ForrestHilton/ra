This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>Many small improvements in wording in 8.1.
<li>Relabel some of the indices in 8.1 and improve the typesetting at the
  same time.  Use \(k\) more consistently when running
  over the indices, \(n\) for size of a basis, and \(m\) for the size of
  a set of vectors.
<li>Add "Compare ..." for Exercises 8.1.4 and 8.1.16 to reference each other.
<li>Reword Exercise 8.1.18 to be slightly clearer.
<li>In 8.2 as in 8.1, avoid \(j\) as an index in some places.
<li>Be more precise in the statement of Proposition 8.2.10.
<li>More consistent use of indices in section 8.6.  Use \(\ell) and \(m\)
  for components of \(x,\) \(k\) for order and don't use \(j\) at all
  (the others are easier to read, typeset more nicely)
<li>Add figure 9.2 for Exercise 9.1.6.
<li>Proposition 11.2.7 needs to assume that \(Y\) is Cauchy-complete
  (erratum), then perhaps it is not completely clear why 11.2.8 is a
  corollary since we do not assume completeness, so add a note on why.
<li>Be more consistent with indices in subsection 11.3.4, replace \(j\) with \(m\) in
  the first part to be consistent with the second part.  Also add
  comma between the indices as in some of the other places.
<li>Similarly for Exercise 11.3.1.
<li>Rename section 11.4 "Complex exponential and trigonometric functions"
  (remove the definite articles for simplicity)
<li>Make indices in the Fourier series section 11.8 more consistent
