This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>In the last estimate of the proof of 11.8.12, there is an unnecessary
	step that was there to use a real version of Cauchy-Schwarz
	inequality (but the complex one is referred to here).  So the middle
	line in the estimate can just be removed.
