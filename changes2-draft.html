This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>Many small improvements in wording in 8.1.
<li>Add the addition/scaling meaning to the arrow figure (8.1), and
  mention it in text.
<li>In the definition of dimension, make it "\(d\) is the largest
  integer such that \(X\) contains a set of \(d\) linearly independent
  vectors" to make the definition be a priory well-defined instead of
  relying on the following paragraph.  Consequently move the
  statement of the previous definition (there is a set of \(d\)
  linearly independent vectors but not a set of \(d+1\) independent
  vectors) to the paragraph afterwards.
<li>Relabel some of the indices in 8.1 and improve the typesetting at the
  same time.  Use \(k\) more consistently when running
  over the indices, \(n\) for size of a basis, and \(m\) for the size of
  a set of vectors.
<li>Move the remark about it being better to use the abstract definition
  to a more logical place after the \({\mathbb{R}}^n\) example.
<li>Add comment about span being the smallest subspace containing \(Y\)
  after Proposition 8.1.11 to make that sentence about if \(Y\) is already a
  subspace a bit less mysterious.
<li>Right after Proposition 8.1.14, add a short note about linearly
  independent set of \(d\) vectors (where \(d\) is the dimension) automatically
  spans, that's a particular case for \(m=d\) in the last item.
<li>Rewrite the claim in part (ii) in the proof of 8.1.14, and also the
  proof of part (vi).
<li>Add "Compare ..." for Exercises 8.1.4 and 8.1.16 to reference each other.
<li>Reword Exercise 8.1.18 to be slightly clearer.
<li>In 8.2 as in 8.1, avoid \(j\) as an index in some places.
<li>Be more precise in the statement of Proposition 8.2.10.
<li>More consistent use of indices in section 8.6.  Use \(\ell) and \(m\)
  for components of \(x,\) \(k\) for order and don't use \(j\) at all
  (the others are easier to read, typeset more nicely)
<li>Add figure 9.2 for Exercise 9.1.6.
<li>Proposition 11.2.7 needs to assume that \(Y\) is Cauchy-complete
  (erratum), then perhaps it is not completely clear why 11.2.8 is a
  corollary since we do not assume completeness, so add a note on why.
<li>Be more consistent with indices in subsection 11.3.4, replace \(j\) with \(m\) in
  the first part to be consistent with the second part.  Also add
  comma between the indices as in some of the other places.
<li>Similarly for Exercise 11.3.1.
<li>Rename section 11.4 "Complex exponential and trigonometric functions"
  (remove the definite articles for simplicity)
<li>Make indices in the Fourier series section 11.8 more consistent
