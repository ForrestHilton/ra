This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>On page 11, add a short note about the $d+1$ linearly independent
  vectors from the definition of dimension.
<li>In Exercise 8.4.7, assume $q$ is not identically zero.  The result is
  vacuously true even if $q$ is identically zero, but there is no reason to
  make students think about this rather stupid technicality.
<li>The proof in Example 8.1.25 is hopefully clearer.
<li>In definition 8.3.8, remove the definition of the notation $D_j f$.  We
  never used it later.
<li>In Definition 9.2.1, change the definition of "simple" for non-closed
  paths.  Typically a path that bites itself back in the middle is not called
  simple, so rule out that case.
<li>Rename subsection 10.3.3 to "Images of null sets under differentiable
  functions".
<li>In proof of Lemma 10.3.9, say how to prove it for open balls.
<li>Improve definition 10.6.1 to be (much) simpler (though equivalent): Only
  take a finite disjoint union of simple closed sets as we are assuming $U$
  is bounded anyway.
<li>Reorder the proof of Theorem 10.7.2 a little bit to make it more logical.
<li>On page 148, add a short note that the $e^{z+w}=e^ze^w$ leads to a quick
  computation of the power series at any point.
<li>In Corollary 11.37, emphasize that that $a$ is any complex number,
  since just above it was a real number.
<li>In definition of the exponential on page 147 (the definition of
  $E(z)$) explicitly say that this means that it is analytic.
<li>Be more precise in Exercise 11.4.9 to say to derive the power series at the
  origin.
<li>In 11.8.2, when saying we could develop everything with sines and
  cosines, give the actual form of the series and refer to Euler's formula,
  so that when we later call such series also Fourier series, the reader is
  not confused.
