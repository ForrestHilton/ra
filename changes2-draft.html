This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li>Make line in Figure 9.6 a bit bolder to make it easier to pick out.
<li>In Proposition 10.3.7, use $\ell$ for the number of balls to make it
  clear that the number is quite likely different from the number of
  rectangles.
