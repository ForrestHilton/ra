This file is a draft of the new changes for http://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

rename subsection 10.3.3 to "Images of null sets under differentiable
functions"

In proof of Lemma 10.3.9, say how to prove it for open balls.

In Exercise 8.4.7, assume $q$ is not identically zero.  The result is
vacuously true even if $q$ is identically zero, but there is no reason to make students
think about this rather stupid technicality.

The proof in Example 8.1.25 is hopefully clearer.

In definition 8.3.8, remove the definition of the notation $D_j f$.  We never
used it later.

In Definition 9.2.1, change the definition of "simple" for non-closed paths.
Typically a path that bites itself back in the middle is not called simple,
so rule out that case.

Improve definition 10.6.1 to be (much) simpler (though equivalent): Only take
a finite disjoint union of simple closed sets as we are assuming $U$ is
bounded anyway.
