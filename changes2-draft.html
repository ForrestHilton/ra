This file is a draft of the new changes for https://www.jirka.org/ra/changes2.html

<li><b>Change exercise 8.5.8</b> to fix erratum, namely change part e to have the
  student check that the map is not open.
<li>The word "domain" meaning "open connected set" was sometimes used without
  being defined. We have only defined it in a special case in 10.6 and
  another in 9.3, so reword all other places where it was used.
<li>Namely, change Exercise  10.6.3 to say that \(U\) is just an open set,
  the student might read "domain" as meaning in the specific
  sense it was used in the section which isn't needed.
